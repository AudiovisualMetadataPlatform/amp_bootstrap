These are things we'll need to look out for when installing to something that
isn't RockyLinux 8 on x86_64.  

* rhel9 got rid of the powertools repository

That shouldn't be a big deal to update.  It's mostly there because EPEL 
requires it for some packages.  Maybe it's not required for EPEL9?

* postgres repositories are broken with the GPG keys and then it breaks all 
  of the rest of the repos, so ansible script crashes

Postgres' repos tend to break the gpg key and then break all things dnf.  It's 
unfortunate.  We have a dependency on version 12 and RHEL 8 ships with 10.
Not sure if that's a hard dependency or not.  Maybe we should revisit that.
Also, not sure why it would fail on a /clean/ install.  

* amppd-ui doesn't build because node-sass wants a "python" command to build 
  and that's not installed on the system.

This case was from RL8 on aarch64.  Apparently prebuilt libraries didn't exist
for aarch64 Linux so node-sass tried to build them...and failed looking for
the python command (which isn't installed because it used to refer to 
Python 2.7 which has been out of service for years)

* the gentle mgm won't build

The default singularity script won't work because it defines the haswell 
architecture for openblas, and that's not an ARM thing.  It also wants to
install the nvidia-cuda-dev package, which doesn't make sense on ARM.  




good things
---
* java 11, node 14 are there and work
* amppd repo builds on RL8 on aarch64
* singularity builds /do/ grab the correct architecture from dockerhub
* visual studio code will work with a remote aarch64 machine (specifically, a raspberry pi)
* mgm_python.sif builds and works when I tested it.
* gentle will not build because it wants cuda
